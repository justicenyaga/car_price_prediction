# Multiple Linear Regression - Class Assignment

Your task for this assignment is to perform multi linear regression. Your task involves:
<ol type="i">
<li> Importing Required Libraries </li>
<li> Loading the required Data </li>
<li> Perform the necessary data explanatory, which include but not limited to correlation of the various features </li>
<li> Split the data into feature matrix and target vector </li>
<li> Divide the data into training and testing sets. </li>
<li> Create a linear regression model and fit it with existing data. </li>
<li> Plot the model within Jupyter notebook </li>
<li> Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory. </li>
<li> Apply the model for predictions.</li>
</ol>

You have discretion of selecting your own appropriate data set, one easy source is the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), which contain many data sets, not all of which are appropriate for linear regression. So you'll need to do some thinking. You are also welcome to identify data from other sources, especially those that you find personally of interest.
